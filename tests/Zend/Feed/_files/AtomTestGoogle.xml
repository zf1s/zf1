<br/>Today is the one year anniversary of the <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/mini/">Google Mini</a>, Google's solution for website and corporate network search, and to celebrate we thought we'd announce a few more of them. The standard Mini lets you search up to 100,000 documents. Now organizations that constantly crank out new content can opt for either of two new Minis: one searches up to 200,000 documents, and another that can manage up to 300,000. All three deliver the same easy setup, intuitive interface and fast, relevant results that the Mini is already bringing to thousands of websites and corporate networks. You're growing, and <a href="http://www.googlestore.com/appliance/product.asp?catid=1">the Mini is growing with you</a>.</div>

<br/>We feel like proud parents around here.  Our eldest, Google Earth for the PC, is officially leaving beta status today, and we couldn't be more pleased. For those of you who downloaded early, upgrade to the latest and discover Google Earth all over again.<br/>
<br/>And we have a brand new member of the family -- Google Earth for Macintosh. We're happy to finally have some good news for the, ahem, vocal Mac enthusiasts we've been hearing from. Let's just say that we have gotten more than a few "requests" for a Mac version of Google Earth.  They've gone something like this:<br/>
<br/>1) "When is it coming out?  Your website says that you are working on it."<br/>
<br/>2) "You know, Mac users are very heavy graphics/mapping/visualization/design/ architecture/education/real estate/geocaching/social-geo-video-networking fans who would certainly use Google Earth a lot."<br/>
<br/>3) "So when is it coming out?"<br/>
<br/>We heard you loud and clear.  The Mac version runs on OS X 10.4 and up.  Happy travels throughout <a href="http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html">Google Earth</a>, whether you're on a Mac or a PC.</div>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">A new year for Google Video</title>
<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://googleblog.blogspot.com" xml:space="preserve">&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Sanjay Raman, Google Video Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till now, Google Video has been about watching videos and clips online, which is really convenient for videos &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3496860874967925614&amp;q=fastfocus"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;. But wouldn't it be awesome to watch that episode of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DCSI"&gt;CSI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that you missed when even your trusty DVR failed you? This is one reason we've launched the Google Video store, where you can rent or buy from such well-known media partners as &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/cbs.html"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/nba.html"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DCharlie_Rose"&gt;Charlie Rose Show&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Sony+BMG"&gt;SONY BMG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’re not only about mainstream content, though -– we have thousands of titles available (and more coming every day) from every imaginable type of producer, including &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=1896+tsar+nicholas&amp;so=0"&gt;this 1896 clip&lt;/a&gt; of the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II – one of the earliest known moving images. We’re especially pleased to offer such quality indie features as Ben Rekhi’s &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1607114503824678810&amp;q=waterborne "&gt;Waterborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Drops Entertainment) and Lerone Wilson’s &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4929215594503422280&amp;q=aardvark%27d "&gt;Aardvark’d: 12 Weeks with Geeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Boondoggle Films).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we launched our &lt;a href="https://upload.video.google.com"&gt;Upload Program&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, people sent in a huge number of free and compelling videos. But  since there's a ton of video that can't be offered for free, we built the &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/"&gt;Google Video store&lt;/a&gt; to give content owners the option to charge for downloads if they'd like. This means producers large and small can distribute their great content in an easy, secure way. Some of your favorite prime time and classic TV shows, sports, music videos, and documentaries are at your fingertips. Want to see how Shaq scored 30 points last night? Download and watch it (and every &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/nba.html"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; game for the rest of the season) through Google Video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can play all the videos you download using the all-new Google Video Player. We're especially pleased about the thumbnail navigation for browsing an entire video so you can play any portion with a single click. And there's another thing: if the content is not copy-protected, you can take your favorite videos with you on your &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; -- our "to go" option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it's so early in the year, here's a resolution we intend to keep: make sure new features and content continue to roll out, so that you think Google Video is one of the best ways to find video on the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These video providers are getting us off to a great start:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Aowner%3Daquarius"&gt;Aquarius Health Care Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: A leading producer and distributor of healthcare-related videos will pilot with Google Video using a variety of titles covering SIDS, diabetes, and blindness, among other health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=ardustry"&gt;Ardustry Home Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Offers substantial libraries of theatrical motion pictures, television series, documentaries and reality programming, music and sports specials, lifestyle titles, and a wide array of “how-to” products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=bluehighways"&gt;BlueHighways TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Programming service that explores the people, stories, traditions and cultures of America. Discovering the sights and sounds of communities across the country with an up-close, laid-back programming style, BlueHighways TV presents a collage of remarkable music, folklore and information for audiences interested in all aspects of American life and heritage. Programming includes &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Reno's Old Time Music Festival,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;American Journeys,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Stan Hitchcock's Heart to Heart,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gospel Sampler&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Aowner%3Dcaretalk"&gt;CareTALK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: A multimedia brand dedicated to consumer-directed health care offering programming and tools to help modern family caregivers; initially offering 10-20 hours of health and caregiving-related content (10-20 minutes in length).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://video.google.com/cbs.html"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;: Includes prime time hits such as &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DCSI"&gt;CSI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3Dncis"&gt;NCIS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DSurvivor_Guatemala"&gt;Survivor: Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, and The Amazing Race (available spring ’06), as well as classics like &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=I+Love+Lucy"&gt;I Love Lucy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DTwilight_Zone"&gt;Twilight Zone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DBrady_Bunch"&gt;Brady Bunch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Have+Gun+Will+Travel"&gt;Have Gun Will Travel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DMacGyver"&gt;MacGyver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DStar_Trek_Deep_Space_Nine"&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DStar_Trek_Voyager"&gt;Star Trek: Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, and My Three Sons (coming soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=in_label%3Atvshow%3DCharlie_Rose"&gt;The Charlie Rose Show&lt;/a&gt;: Includes interviews with Henry Kissinger, Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, Martha Stewart, Martin Scorsese, Harrison Ford, Dan Rather, Charles M.

<br/>
<br/>The wonderfully-named Dr. Anita Borg (1949 - 2003) was a rebel with a cause:  ensuring that technology itself has positive outcomes, and dismantling barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and  technology fields. Today the <a href="http://www.anitaborg.org">Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology</a> carries on her vision. And because Google shares that passion, we are pleased to sponsor the <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/">2006 Anita Borg Scholarship program</a>. We are inspired by the <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/profiles.html">past scholarship recipients</a> -- and in hopes of finding more, the program is expanded this year to accept applications from students entering their senior  year of undergraduate study as well as those enrolled in a graduate program. <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/anitaborg.html">Last year</a> we awarded 23 scholarships; this year we'd like to do more.<br/>
<br/>Tell your friends, or <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/">apply</a> yourself - the deadline is January 20.</div>

<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://googleblog.blogspot.com" xml:space="preserve">&lt;span class="byline-author"&gt;Posted by Jesse Savage, Google Pack team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So you bought a new PC for yourself or a relative during the holidays. There was the initial excitement about its speed and the nice screen – and then it came time to actually get it running. Which meant embarking on some real work -– downloading a browser, a couple of multimedia players, a PDF reader, a toolbar, and maybe something for voice and instant messaging. Don’t forget the anti-spyware and anti-virus apps – you’ve got to have those. Hours, maybe even days, go by. How many wizards have you clicked through, not to mention license agreements and preference pickers? And then you have to ask: did I get everything? And how am I going to keep all of this up to date?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This was the experience both Sergey and Larry had a year ago. And they’re computer guys, after all. Which led them to ask more of us to make it easier for everyone.  So we created the &lt;a href="http://pack.google.com"&gt;Google Pack&lt;/a&gt; -- a one-stop software package that helps you discover, install, and maintain a wide range of essential PC programs. It’s yours today – and it’s something we hope you find to be painless, easy, and even fun (if computer setup can ever be called that). And it’s free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We worked with a number of technology companies to identify products that are the best of their type to create &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/pack"&gt;this suite&lt;/a&gt;. (We didn’t pay them, and they aren’t paying us.) For PC users running Windows XP, it downloads in minutes and installs in just a few clicks. There’s only one license agreement – and no wizards. And there’s a new tool called the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/pack/bin/answer.py?answer=30252&amp;topic=8326/"&gt;Google Updater&lt;/a&gt; that keeps all the software in the Google Pack current. Even if you already have some of the software in the Pack, you can use the Google Updater to update and manage it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There’s one more thing in the Pack that we think you’ll like. The Pack team asked people what kind of screensavers they like best. They kept saying, “I want my own photos as a screensaver, why can’t I do that?” Good question -- lots of people have trouble with this. So we made the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/pack/bin/answer.py?answer=28076&amp;topic=8315"&gt;Google Pack Screensaver&lt;/a&gt;, which is the easiest possible way to make your photos into an animated photo collage. And now the question for you is: what will you do with all that time you've saved?</content>

In closing out the first full year of our company-wide effort to share news and views, we thought you might be interested in a few factoids. Since we've had Google Analytics running on this blog since June, some of these numbers reflect only half a year. In that time, 4.3 million unique visitors have generated 8.7 million pageviews. Readers have come from all over the world, not just English-speaking countries: 53,001 visitors from Turkey have stopped by, for example; so have 155,691 from France, 29,614 from Thailand and 8,233 from Peru. <br/>
<br/>The most popular posts? Here are a few that have yielded scores of backlinks: <br/> <br/>- <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html">Our explanation of "Googlebombing"</a>  <br/>- <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/guess-what-just-turned-34.html">A celebration of email and Gmail</a>  <br/>- <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/illuminated-continent.html">Google Earth's partnership with National Geographic</a> about Africa <br/>

We've featured 11 guest bloggers. Forty posts have illuminated something about day to day life at Google; 19 have offered some international perspective. <br/> <br/>In 2006, we'll keep up the Google Blog with more posts, more bloggers, and even more topics. Meanwhile, we really appreciate your interest and feedback, now visible through "Links to this post." We know some of you would like to offer comments directly, and we would like that too, when we can add resources to the blog crew. Meanwhile, our best to you and yours for the New Year.</div>
